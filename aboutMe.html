		<h1>About me</h1>
		Born and raised in Midland, Michigan, I'm certainly not well-accomplished in any field enough to yet warrant a self-congratulatory website, but here's one anyways.  After spending two years studying film at Columbia College Chicago, I decided I'd be better off making money to finance my movie ideas in some other way.  I transferred to University of Michigan with the intention of studying Computer Science and ultimately left with a B.A. in Psychology (long story), and a minor in American Culture.  Since then, I've started learning Java development at Grand Circus coding boot camp in order to land my first job in software development.  Along the way, I've accumulated a fairly sizeable videography and photography portfolio which can be found on this site and I hope you enjoy it!
